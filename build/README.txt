# Application Icons

For packaging the application, you'll need to add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon.ico - Windows icon (256x256 pixels recommended)
2. icon.icns - macOS icon
3. icon.png - Linux icon (512x512 pixels recommended)

You can create these icons using an image editor or an online icon generator service.

## Icon Requirements

- Windows (.ico): 256x256 pixels (minimum)
- macOS (.icns): 1024x1024 pixels (recommended)
- Linux (.png): 512x512 pixels (recommended)
